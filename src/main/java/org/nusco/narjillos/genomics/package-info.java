/**
 * DNA syntax.
 * 
 * This package contains classes that deal with DNA, but no related
 * semantics. In other words, the classes in here don't know what a
 * specific DNA mean - they treat genes as meaningless data.
 * 
 * The most important classes and interfaces here are
 * {@link org.nusco.narjillos.genomics.DNA},
 * {@link org.nusco.narjillos.genomics.Chromosome}, the
 * {@link org.nusco.narjillos.creature.genetics.Creature} interface, and
 * a few support classes that process genes.
