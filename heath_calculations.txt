blocks: 1600

typical range of energy consumption per tick: 0.1 to 1, average 0.2  (for very evolved creatures)
min energy to lay egg: 10K
food energy: 30K
max lifetime: 100K

a "good" creature consumes 3 pieces of food in its lifetime in the current environment. this means about 90K extra energy in 100K ticks. so, best case: a "good" creature receives 1 energy per tick

now let's calculate the equivalent of food when you take out food and use elements and heat instead. for each heath point, a "good" creature will transform it 100% ("good" in this case means that it has a favourite element ration of 1.0).
so, for each point of heath per tick, we'll make one creature survive.
